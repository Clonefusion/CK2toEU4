\section{How to use the converter}

\begin{itemize}
\item Download the zip file: \url{https://github.com/kingofmen/VickyToHoI3/archive/master.zip}.
\item Unpack it. 
\item Ignore the source code unless you intend to modify it. 
\item Copy the CK2 savegame you intend to convert into the release
  directory. 
\item Start the CK2toEU4 executable. 
\item Go to File->Load file and select your savegame. 
\item Wait for it to load - it will take a minute or two. If it takes
  more than five minutes, you have either a very slow computer, or a
  problem - go to Troubleshooting, below. 
\item Go to Actions->Convert to EU4. Wait until it says ``Done
  writing''. If the output stops for more than a few minutes with any
  other message, especially one starting `Error', go to
  Troubleshooting. 
\item Conversion is now done. Go to the Output directory. It should
  contain `converted.eu4'. Move this to your EU4 savegames folder; on
  my machine this is on C:\\Users\\UserName\\My Documents\\Paradox
  Interactive\\Europa Universalis IV, but installations differ. 
\item Start EU4 as usual. The converted game should appear as a
  regular saved game; select your country and play. If it crashes or
  hangs on loading, or within a few days of starting, go to
  Troubleshooting. 
\item Conquer \emph{All} the Pixels! 
\end{itemize}

\section{Troubleshooting}

These are the most common issues people have had:
\begin{itemize}
\item EU4 crashes on loading the converted save. This is very often a
  bug, which I'll try to fix (see below). However, there are two
  causes that you can fix yourself: One, your Crusader Kings savegame
  has names containing a hashtag, `\#'. This confuses the
  parser. In that case just remove the hashtag. (Removing other
  unusual characters may also be worth a try.) Two, do note that the
  converted savegame is meant for EU4 with all four expansions, and
  that if you don't have all three the game will choke.
\item No converted save file. This is often caused by
  impatience. Don't click ``convert'' immediately after ``load file'',
  it takes some time to parse forty megabytes of savegame.
\end{itemize}

If none of the above is your problem: Upload your (zipped) Crusader Kings
savegame somewhere, then send me (``King of Men'') a PM on Paradox,
Ederon, or (``King\_of\_Men'') reddit with a link to the upload. Try to be as
specific as possible about what the problem is - I cannot debug
``things look weird''. Screenshots and province IDs are often
helpful. I'll run the
debugging version of the converter and try to fix the
problem. If you are skilled at C++ development in Windows you can also
try to compile in debug mode and run gdb on it.
